## About

This is a simple program that allows a user to get a certain character from a string by providing the characters place with a number index. This can be useful for some services that require a user to input the 'nth character' from their password instead of the password itself.

## How To Use

My intention is that this can be used in a simple command line interface.

To do this you can create a jar file from the source code or use the one I already created, and use the following command: `java -jar Name_Of_File.jar` within a Windows command line or a Linux terminal.

Alternatively you can create a batch file for Windows or a shell script for Linux.

#### For a Windows batch file:
```batch
java -jar Name_Of_File.jar
```

#### For a Linux shell script:
```shell
#!/bin/bash
java -jar Name_Of_File.jar
```
