# About

This is a simple program that allows a user to get a certain character from a string by providing the characters place with a number index. This can be useful for some services that require a user to input the 'nth character' from their password instead of the password itself.

# How To Use

My intention is that this can be used in a simple command line interface.

To do this you can create a .jar file from the source code and use the following command: > java -jar Name_Of_File.jar within a command line or copy it into a windows batch file.

Alternatively you can use the run.bat script I already created.
